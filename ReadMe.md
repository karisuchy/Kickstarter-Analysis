# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analyze previous Kickstarter campaigns to provide helpful information to Louise so she can develop a successful crowd funding campaign for her new play "Fever".

### Purpose
The goal of this analysis it to determine what factors led to successful or failed campaigns so Louise can use these insights to structure her campaign for success.  

## Analysis and Challenges

Though her immediate focus is a play in the US, Louise also has a future interest for a musical in Great Britan. I concentrated my analysis on Kickstarter campaigns in the US or UK related to theaters. Launch dates, length of fundraising campaigns, goal amounts, average donations, and types of productions were considered.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


My greatest challenge was learning and understanding the terms, formulas, and meanings behind the statistical analysis.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The summer, specifically May, June, and July, are the best three months to launch a campaign. 
It is best to avoid starting a campaign during the winter months of November through February. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The best chance for campaign success is to have a projected goal of less than $20,000. 
Campaigns with goals exceeding $45,000 almost always lead to failure so should avoided. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

We do not know the quality of the plays or the marketing strategies used for the campaigns in the Kickstarter database.  Both of these factors could have a big impact on the success or failure of previous campaigns. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Additional analysis could focus on the correlation between staff picks and spotlights on successful campaigns.
