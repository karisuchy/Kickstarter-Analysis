# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is to analyze previous Kickstarter campaigns to provide helpful information to Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, so she can develop a successful crowd funding campaign for her new play "Fever".

### Purpose
The goal of this analysis it to determine what factors led to successful or failed campaigns in the past so Louise can use these insights to structure her campaign for success.  

## Analysis and Challenges

The dataset that was used contained information from 4114 different Kickstarter campaigns. Within this dataset, there were 1392 theater-related campaigns from 19 different counties. 

Though her immediate focus is a play in the US, Louise also has an interest for a future musical in Great Britan. I concentrated my analysis on Kickstarter theater campaigns in the US or UK. Launch dates, length of fundraising campaigns, goal amounts, average donations, and types of productions were considered. 



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


My greatest challenge was learning and understanding the terms, formulas, and meanings behind the statistical analysis. I overcame the challenge by reading the module information several times, reviewing the instructor slides, and doing some basic research on google.  

## Results

- The summer, specifically May, June, and July, are the best three months to launch a successful campaign. 
- It is best to avoid starting a campaign during the winter months of November through February. 
- The best chance for campaign success is to have a project goal of less than $20,000. 
- Campaigns with goals exceeding $45,000 almost always lead to failure so should avoided. 
- We do not know the quality of the plays or the marketing strategies used for the campaigns in the Kickstarter database.  Both of these factors could have a big impact on the success or failure of previous campaigns. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Additional analysis could focus on the correlation between staff picks and spotlights on successful campaigns.
