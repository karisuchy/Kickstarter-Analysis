# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analyze previous kickstarter campaigns to provide helpful in formation to Louise so she can develop a successful crowd funding campaign for her new play "Fever".

### Purpose
The goal of this analysis it to determine what factors led to successful or failed campaigns so Louise can use these insights to structure her campaign for success.  

## Analysis and Challenges



My Challenge was learning the terms and meanings behind the statiscal analysis.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The summer, specifically May, June, and July, are the best three months to launch a campaign. 
It is best to avoid starting a campaign during the winter months of November through February. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The best chance for campaign success is to have a projected goal of less than $20,000. 
Campaigns with goals exceeding $45,000 almost always lead to failure so should avoided. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

We do not know the quality of the plays or the marketing strategies used for the campaigns in the Kickstarter database.  Both of these factors could have a big impact on the success or failure of previous campaigns. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
